git add
git commit
git push
git merge?

github GUI sync button

git --work-tree=yourSrcFolder add .
(done from the root directory of your cloned Git repo, then git commit -m "a msg", and git push origin master)


Questions:
Order of creation. Branches, forks, repositories, should I create them online first then pull?


Branches seem to be for making small edits and merging back into main file
